Important commands:

docker rmi image_name --> remove the image
docker rm containerID --> remove the container

docker ps -a --> show all the containers
docker images --> show all the images

docker run image-name:version

IMPORTANT!

Every time we decide to make changes in the Dockerfile we need to rebuild the container:
1) Delete image and the container
2) Make the changes
3) Build the image with: docker build -t name:version_tag .

Base Dockerfile commands:

FROM ---> take image from docker hub ---> similar with local installation

ENV ---> Optionally define environment variables. In general is better to define the environment variables external, in
docker-compose.yml because is possible to be changed and dockerfile do not overridden.

RUN ---> execute any Linux command
example: RUN mkdir -p /home/app --> this directory is created INSIDE of the container, not in my laptop or in my HOST ENV

COPY . /home/app ---> executes on the HOST machine, not on the container!!!!!!

CMD ["node", "server.js"] ---> entrypoint command. You can have multiple RUN commands, but just one CMD.


INFO DOCKER VOLUMES
3 Volume Types
A) Docker command
    - docker run ---> -v/home/mount/data:/ var/lib/mysql/data Host Volumes --> you decide where on the host file system the reference is made
    - docker run ---> -v/home/mount/data:/  Anonymous Volumes --> for each container a folder is generated that gets mounted
    - docker run ---> -v name: var/lib/mysql/data Named Volumes --> you can reference the volume by bane. This type should be used in production
B) Docker compose
 mariaDb:
    image: ...
    ports:
    volumes:
     - ....
